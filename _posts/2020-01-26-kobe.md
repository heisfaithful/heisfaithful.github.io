I think what made Kobe’s death so shocking, was that we all believed he was somehow invincible. He’s a man that had everything, and if anybody could survive a helicopter crash, it would be him.

It was a sobering reminder of the fragility of life, and that no amount of wealth, fame or legacy can guarantee yourself even one more breath of life. That's an absolutely scary thought if you don't know what happens to you after you die.

It’s a tragedy that the sports world lost an icon. It’s a tragedy that his family has to live without him and his daughter. However, the greatest tragedy from today is that they died, presumably, without knowing and being saved by the God that created them. That is what caused me to mourn today, and that is what makes this so difficult to swallow.

I had a long talk with my boys about today’s events. I explained to them that nobody knows when they’re going to die. Nobody woke up this morning, thinking today would be Kobe’s last day on earth. I also told them that they could be the best students or baseball players, but if they don’t know Jesus, then nothing they do in this life matters. We are not guaranteed another day of life, and we cannot take any of our wealth or accolades with us into eternity. Today was a very sad reminder of that.

When tragic events occur, it causes people to think more deeply about what happens after they die. As people mourn the loss of their favorite athlete, I hope we will all pause and reflect on the brevity of life and what happens after we die. We are here today and gone tomorrow, and while life is short, the afterlife is eternal. It is a scary thought to not know when you will take your last breath, but as a Christian, there is no fear in death. When I die, I am confident in knowing that I will live forever in heaven with Jesus because He died for my sins. For that reason, there is a longing and great anticipation for the eternal life that is to come.
