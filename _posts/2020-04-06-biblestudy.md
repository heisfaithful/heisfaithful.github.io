We've moved to doing virtual Bible studies, virtual small groups, etc. It can be tough to try and avoid getting distracted in this format, especially since we're sitting at home at our computer which is not typically where most of us typically are for Bible study. In view of that, a friend from Berean College Ministry created this graphic with some helpful tips.

I think the big upshot is this: Think of a virtual Bible study or a virtual church service as you would the "real thing". Prepare for it in the same way, and give it your best attention. Work hard to resist any temptation to check the news or social media. God deserves our absolute best, as do our brothers and sisters in Christ we're meeting with.
