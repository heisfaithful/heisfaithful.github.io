Recently, I started a series on [worship and argued that *why* we do things often matters as much to God as *what* we do](https://heisfaithful.github.io/worship/2020/02/13/worship.html). God wants our love and worship, not just outward conformity. Today, I want to explain how this realization has impacted my life and my understanding of what church should be like.




- connection to "Church as family" post -- if the church is getting X wrong, why don't the leaders just tell people do do X differently? Serve more, etc.?
- Now see the wisdom in not. Give people the principles; let the Holy Spirit work to bring conviction, challenge, spur on
- Two people might be in the same place but need very different approach; one needs to be encouraged, another rebuked. One is trying hard to please God but nearly overwhelmed, the other is spiritually lazy and needs prodding into action.
