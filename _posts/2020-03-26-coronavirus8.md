I've had a few things piling up that I wanted to share, so today I'll do a bit of a mish-mash. I'll give a few more resources I've run across that seemed helpful, share a way in which God was challenging me today, and link to a number of news/analysis articles about COVID-19 that I thought were worthwhile.

## Resources, helpful links and activities

I've come across several more helpful resources and fun activities to pass on in the last week or so:
- [Houseparty](https://www.houseparty.com/) is an app which allows video chat while playing games -- trivia games, pictionary-like games, and a variety of others. My research group celebrated a lab birthday this way and it was a hit; a decent substitute for hanging out in person. It's available on the App Store and Google Play; the web app may not have the games feature.
- [skribbl.io](https://skribbl.io/): The kids have been enjoying playing this web version of pictionary with one another, or with friends while video chatting. If you have younger kids, probably don't let them just play with the general public as the chat is not locked down. Houseparty is probably superior as it also has video chat, but it's a phone app, whereas this will work for anyone with a computer.
- TGC had an article, [30 Edifying Things to Watch When Stuck at Home](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/30-edifying-things-watch-stuck-at-home/); I got some new movie ideas from there.
- For those who have Netflix, there's a "Netflix Party" thing where you can watch a movie with friends
- [mycircle.tv](https://www.mycircle.tv/) is a somewhat similar idea but for Vimeo, YouTube and others; we've used it to watch a Bible study in sync with friends, but there should be diverse uses. (Thanks, Everest!) 

On a more directly virus-related front, the [WSJ had an article on cleaning your phone](https://www.wsj.com/articles/should-you-clean-your-phone-to-combat-coronavirus-definitely-maybe-11584018237?mod=e2fb) recently. A subscription is probably required, so the brief version is:
- Should you clean it? Maybe. It's probably less likely to be contagious than many other surfaces, but indeed it can get dirty.
- If you clean it, phone makers (Apple, Samsung, Google etc.) are now saying use at least 55% isopropyl alcohol (up to 70%), or Clorox disinfecting wipes. (Dampen a soft cloth)
- Never use bleach
- WSJ itself wiped phones 1000+ times to ensure these were OK; they found even after 1000+ wipes, the oleophobic layer (protective coating) still remained. So wipe with confidence.

## How I was challenged today

On my run today, I finished this [excellent biography of Bonhoeffer](https://amzn.to/33PWgYx) and hearing how he died -- boldly and peacefully going to his execution by hanging for his role in the plot to assassinate Hitler -- set me to thinking about death. In some ways, with COVID-19 around (and on our street, even), it's already on my mind. Just before his death, Bonhoeffer famously said, "This is for me the end, the beginning of life," expressing his confidence that death is just a gateway to the lasting and greater life to come in Christ.

I asked myself, "Am I really ready for death?" I believe the answer is "yes", because I have repented of my sins and trust in Christ, that his work on the cross was for me, and I know that "to die is gain" (Phil. 1:21). And in some way, death will mean peace, rest, and joy with him. But if I'm really honest with myself about it, I do fear -- not so much my own death but I fear what would happen if my family members got sick and were to die. And there's a mix of emotions and desires behind that fear. I fear for those in my family who do not yet know Christ; I want them to be saved before they die. Perhaps some aspect of that is a good fear -- but I need to trust God. At Bonhoeffer's funeral, one of the funeral sermons dealt with Matthew 10:16-31, including 10:30-31, "But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. So do not fear; you are more valuable than many sparrows." (NASB) This was a great reminder to me, as I listened, that God has my family members who do not yet know Christ (which includes most of my children) in his hands and I can completely trust him with them.

I also thought about my wife, and realized I fear what would happen if she got sick or died. Not only would I miss her, but I feel like she's the glue that holds our family together, the one who understands our children best and is able to help them in ways I can't. But also, I fear how much work there would be to do without her, and how bleak my life could seem without her. Well, God really rebuked me about my selfishness in this line of thinking. Philippians applies again, where Paul wrote, "For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain. But if I am to live on in the flesh, this will mean fruitful labor for me; and I do not know which to choose". I need this same attitude -- to love Christ enough that I delight to serve him however he calls me to, even if that means difficult labor.

So, whatever happens, I need to join Bonhoeffer and so many others who have gone before in trusting God -- knowing that nothing can happen to us that is outside of his control -- and in delighting to serve him, whether it is by staying here or crossing over.

## Some news and analysis I felt was worth reading

- [Russell Moore (of the Southern Baptist Convention) had a nice NYT OpEd](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/opinion/coronavirus-elderly-vulnerable-religion.html?action=click&module=Opinion&pgtype=Homepage) on how life -- including the lives of the old -- is valuable.
- [The Atlantic surveys possible timelines for where things go from here](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-social-distancing-over-back-to-normal/608752/); this is very helpful for understanding the range of possible scenarios we face. We may be in for a long haul.
- [This video looks at what's been going on inside one of the hard-hit hospitals in NYC](https://www.nytimes.com/video/players/offsite/index.html?videoId=100000007052136). It's brief, and very concerning.
- The New York Times on the [people and situation in Italy](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/27/world/europe/coronavirus-italy-bergamo.html?action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage); it puts faces to the numbers
- The Times also has an [interactive modeling tool](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/25/opinion/coronavirus-trump-reopen-america.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage) for seeing how different interventions assumptions about the virus might impact number of infections, hospitalizations and deaths
- [Richard Fernandez calls us to offer an alternative to China's approach](https://pjmedia.com/richardfernandez/world-war-v/) -- how do we offer a way out of what he's calling "World War V" (with "V" for "virus") without becoming a surveillance state which dramatically curtails individual liberties
- I don't normally agree with many NYT OpEds, but here are a couple more I generally agree with: [All Americans Need to Shelter in Place](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/opinion/coronavirus-trump-lockdown.html?action=click&module=Opinion&pgtype=Homepage) and [14 Days: That's the most time we have to defeat the coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/opinion/contributors/us-coronavirus-response.html?action=click&module=Opinion&pgtype=Homepage) (though now it'd be 10 days).
- Some [medical schools are graduating their students early](https://twitter.com/Brief_19/status/1243228684682768386) so they can help
