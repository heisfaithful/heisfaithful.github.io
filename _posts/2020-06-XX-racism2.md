## It's about sin

Ultimately, though, racism results from sin. No system will completely fix it, [and when we lose sight of that, it further divides us](https://heisfaithful.github.io/politics/2020/01/18/politics-and-sin.html). This doesn't mean we shouldn't try and improve our systems to reduce racism and restrain sin. We should! But sin doesn't result solely from problems with the system. People will sin even in the best system.

Bear with me for a minute. I'm not saying there aren't problems with the system. There are, and we need to work to address them. But I want us to remember that, even with the best system humans can concieve, people will still do terrible things sometimes. Trainings won't fix it, changes to circumstances won't fix it, improving the system won't fix it. That's the nature of sin -- it comes from our hearts.
