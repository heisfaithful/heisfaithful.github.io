"He is Faithful" covers a range of topics relating to Christian faith, practice, and thought, as well as the authors' life experiences. It seeks to testify to God's faithfulness and love, demonstrated most importantly in sending His son Jesus Christ to provide forgiveness and salvation to all who believe in his name.
